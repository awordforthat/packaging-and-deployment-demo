# Activity: Guess the missing word! â„¢

Objective: To have fun recognizing some of the concepts used in packaging, and realizing that a few words have a different meaning according to the context.
Instructions: A speaker reads each of the items below, saying "blank" where there is a missing word, The participants can raise their hand and when selected by the speaker, will guess the word. If nobody raises their hand, the speaker will select someone at random.

1. When we start to learn about packaging in Python, we will eventually read the following sentence in one of the official web pages:
   "The **********\_\_\_********** is the authoritative resource on how to package, publish, and install Python projects using current tools."

2. The following sentence is true, although it may appear to be confusing when read as is:
   "To deploy a ******\_\_\_\_****** package you need to create a ******\_\_\_****** package."

3. The following definition should be easy to complete, can you do it?:
   "Building consists of creating a ****\_\_\_\_**** distribution or a ******\_****** distribution, or both."

4. Ready for a different use of the word "build"? You will find the following two sentences in one of the official packaging web pages:
   "Building your understanding of Python packaging is a **\_\_\_**". "******\_\_****** and ******\_\_\_\_****** are key to success."
   Bonus question: Do you know how to display the text of the Zen of Python?

5. When you start to learn about publishing packages, you will find the following notice in one of the official web pages:
   "********\_\_\_******** is a separate instance of ********\_\_\_******** that allows you to try distribution tools and processes without affecting the real index."
   Bonus question: Who knows where in the documentation is this explained?
